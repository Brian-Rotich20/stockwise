1. Product CRUD routes with tenant isolation
2. Category management routes
3. Supplier management routes
4. Inventory tracking endpoints

 What You've Accomplished in Product CRUD routes with tenant isolation
✅ Complete CRUD operations for products
✅ Tenant isolation - Users can only access their own products
✅ Role-based permissions - Admin/Manager for create/update, Admin for delete
✅ Advanced filtering - Search, category, price range, low stock
✅ Pagination - Handle large datasets efficiently
✅ Sorting - By name, price, quantity, date
✅ SKU validation - Prevent duplicates
✅ Category validation - Ensure category belongs to tenant
✅ Soft delete - Products aren't permanently removed
✅ Low stock alerts - Quick endpoint for inventory monitoring
✅ Statistics - Dashboard data ready
✅ Auto SKU generation - Helper for quick product creation
🔒 Security Features Implemented:

Tenant Isolation - All queries filtered by tenantId
Authentication Required - All routes protected
Role-Based Access - Different permissions for different roles
Input Validation - Zod schemas prevent invalid data
SQL Injection Prevention - Drizzle ORM parameterized queries


✅ What You've Accomplished:
✅ Hierarchical categories - Unlimited nesting depth
✅ Tree structure - JSON tree view for UI rendering
✅ Flat list view - For dropdowns and simple lists
✅ Category path - Breadcrumb navigation (Home > Electronics > Laptops)
✅ Product count - Show how many products in each category
✅ Search - Find categories by name
✅ Parent filtering - Get root or specific level categories
✅ Move categories - Change parent without recreating
✅ Circular reference prevention - Can't make category its own ancestor
✅ Name uniqueness - Within same level (can have "Accessories" under both "Electronics" and "Clothing")
✅ Delete protection - Can't delete categories with products/children
✅ Tenant isolation - Users only see their organization's categories
✅ Statistics - Dashboard data for category insights
✅ Role-based permissions - Create/Update (Admin/Manager), Delete (Admin only)
